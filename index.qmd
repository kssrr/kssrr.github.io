# Introduction

I am Lennart, a Masterâ€™s student of Data Science with an interest in quantitative and computational methods of Political Science. I work as a research assistant for [Max Schaub](https://maxschaub.eu/) at the University of Hamburg, currently on the [generational effect of wartime victimization on interpersonal trust and social norms](https://wargen.eu/index.html). I also volunteer at [CorrelAid](https://www.correlaid.org/), where I am head of the [local chapter Konstanz](https://www.correlaid.org/mitmachen/correlaidx/konstanz).

Here, I mostly write about R & Python programming, and software I recommend. Thanks for stopping by!
